## Installation

In order to use this application, users will need to install npm dependencies using 'npm i' in the command line. Once Express.js and Mongoose have been installed, the application will be ready for use. To initiate the server, users will run 'node server'. Once the server is connected, users can use applications such as Insomnia to manipulate table data.

## Usage

Once 'node server' has been ran in the command line, the user can use applications such as Insomnia to GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE data in the database. The port for this server is currently at 3001, so users can manipulate data using 'localhost:3001/api/' with either 'users' or 'thoughts' following the '/'.
